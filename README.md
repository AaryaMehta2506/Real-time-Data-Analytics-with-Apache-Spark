Data Analytics Advanced Project
# Real-time-Data-Analytics-with-Apache-Spark

This project demonstrates how to perform **real-time data analytics** using **Apache Spark Structured Streaming** in Python.  
We simulate a live data stream, process it in real-time, and display analytics results inside a Jupyter Notebook using an in-memory Spark table.

## 🚀 Features
- **Apache Spark Structured Streaming** in Python
- Real-time word count analytics from incoming data
- Uses an **in-memory table** for displaying streaming results inside Jupyter
- Simulates live data ingestion with time delays
